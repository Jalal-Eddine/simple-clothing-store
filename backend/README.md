# Simple Clothing Store


Hey ya! ╰(￣ω￣ｏ)


I am the backend that hosts the built for production frontend, and also acts as an api middleground to allow communication between the frontend and the various APIs we're using! I'm mostly made out of Node.js & Express.


## I'm using
* A few very nice APIs
  * [Printful REST API](https://www.printful.com/docs)
  * [Paypal REST API](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/overview/)
* Some awesome libraries
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  * [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
  * [currency.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/currency.js)
  * [@paypal/checkout-server-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@paypal/checkout-server-sdk)
  * PrintfulClient utility class (No longer available through Printful)
